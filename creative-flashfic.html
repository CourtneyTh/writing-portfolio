<h2 class="article-title">A Fair Trade</h2>
<p class="article-text">It had been raining for two days straight and there was a thin layer of water over the patio, like a tide pool slowly filling as the waves came crashing in. An ecosystem had even begun to thrive there—little spotted frogs leapt through the water and snails perched themselves on the edges of the steps where the rainwater pooled. A few bright orange newts appeared now and then, finding hiding spots in patches of grass and fallen leaves.</p>
<p class="article-text">Wynona noticed none of this as she stepped into the garden, her heavy rainboots cutting through the water and kicking up large droplets. She pulled the cords of her raincoat to tighten the hood. Bits of her hair hung loose, quickly getting damp from the downpour. She left them be and trudged forward, her dark shape moving across the gloomy sky.</p>
<p class="article-text">Surveying the yard, Wynona looked past its new inhabitants, instead searching for a pop of red against all the greys and greens. She splashed her way over to the two-story shed, finding nothing of use. The rake had fallen over and was lying in the water, probably beginning to rust. She didn’t bother to pick it back up. The forgotten dog toy wedged in between the shed and the fence she left, too.</p>
<p class="article-text">She felt water seeping into her shoes where the rubber soles had torn, and she considered going back inside, but the wailing started back up again, piercing through the ornate glass panels of the garden door. She sighed and continued walking along the perimeter of the fence, her socks beginning to squelch inside her boots.</p>
<p class="article-text">Beneath the water, there was only the well-trimmed grass. Even the frogs had vanished, scurrying out of the way of Wynona’s thundering steps. When she had made her way throughout the entirety of the garden, the ends of hair her sufficiently dampened and her socks soaked through, she sighed and returned to the door. Walking up the short flight of stairs, she spotted a bit of red through the slots between them. She took a step back and crouched to examine it—the little red racecar lay floating in a deep puddle under the steps. She squeezed her hand through the gap and pulled it out, nearly kissing the little plastic car despite the muck that coated it. She held it under the rainfall for a moment to rinse it off and went inside, carrying it like it was made of gold.</p>
<p class="article-text">The crying was overwhelming when she opened the door. She wiped her shoes once on the flowery mat and followed the sound, leaving behind muddy footprints and a trail of water that dripped from her coat and shoes. The little boy was slumped in the living room, a pile of toys and games littering the floor nearby, but his hands empty. Big tears fell down his chubby face, the kind that only children seem to produce, almost cartoonishly plopping down onto the sheepskin rug.</p>
<p class="article-text">“Hey,” Wynona said, crouching down beside him. “I found your car.”</p>
<p class="article-text">He looked up, his face all red and snotty. The crying instantly ceased.</p>
<p class="article-text">“My racecar!” He reached for it, but Wynona pulled her hand back and held the car high in the air.</p>
<p class="article-text">“First you have to tell me where Mommy keeps her jewelry, okay? A deal’s a deal.”</p>
<p class="article-text">The boy looked up at the racecar with wide eyes. “She has a box in her room, way up high in the closet. She puts sparkly things in it.”</p>
<p class="article-text">Wynona smiled and handed him the toy car. “Thanks kid.”</p>
<p class="article-text-last">He grabbed the racecar and began sliding it across the floor, making vroom noises to mimic an engine. Wynona turned away, her socks still squelching, and picked up the black backpack she’d left near the back door. The little garden dwellers reemerged to enjoy the rain as she made her way to the parents’ bedroom.</p>
