<h2 class="article-title">How to Choose the Best Skyline View of NYC</h2>
<p class="article-text-straight">When visiting NYC, one thing at the top of most people’s lists is getting that iconic view of the city’s skyline. With some of the tallest buildings like the Empire State, NYC is a place you really have to see from up high. There are a lot of different ways to see the city this way, so we’ve put together a guide to help you figure out which option you should choose!</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">The Best Cheap View</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">If you’re looking to save money (and avoid crowds), the Brooklyn Bridge offers a pretty great view of the city. It might not take you as high up as some others, but it’s a great place to take a walk and take in the beautiful view.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">The Most Iconic View</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">The Empire State Building is the most iconic place to visit for an aerial view of NYC, and for good reason. Going up to 86 floors (or 102, if you’re willing to shell out an extra $30) the Empire State Building offers an incredible view of the city. Centrally located, it may also be a convenient stop along your route, with Times Square and Rockefeller Center just a few blocks away. The only drawback to the Empire State is that it draws a big crowd, so be prepared, especially if you’re visiting during peak tourism season.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">The Best View to Splurge on</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">If you want to make your viewing of the city skyline into more of an experience, Bar 54 is a rooftop bar and restaurant in Times Square that offers an amazing city view along. You can sit outside and enjoy the sites from 54 floors up while having a drink or meal. This won’t be cheap, but it’s definitely an experience you won’t forget.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">The Best Downtown View</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">If you can’t make it to midtown to see the skyline, the One World Trade Observatory offers a great view of the city from further downtown. The drawbacks are that you can’t see as much of the city (you get a great view of Central Park from some of the midtown observation decks!) But this is still a great option, and as a bonus you can also visit the 9/11 memorial while you’re in the area.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">The Best Value Overall</p>
<p class="article-text-straight-last">Weighing the pros and cons, we found the Top of the Rock Observation Deck to be the best way to view the city skyline. At $40 per ticket, it’s only slightly cheaper than going up the Empire State Building, but allows you to avoid the same amount of crowds that the Empire State attracts. Top of the Rock also only goes up 70 floors high, but this still offers an incredible view of the city, including Central Park. This is also the best way to get a great view of the skyline including the Empire State Building, which is obviously something you can’t get from the ESB.</p>
