<h2 class="article-title">Gifts from Henry</h2>
<p class="article-text">FADE IN:</p>
<p class="article-text">EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING</p>
<p class="article-text">HENRY (20's) waits at the entrance of the building, holding a red HEART-SHAPED BOX of chocolates. His hair is gelled back and he wears a pair of jeans with loafers and a sport coat. He clutches the box and taps his fingers on it.</p>
<p class="article-text">The door opens and a young woman, RACHEL (20's) walks out. She is dressed casually, in leggings and a coat. She rolls her eyes at Henry.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry holds the box out in front of him.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">I know I screwed up, Rachel. I shouldn't have forgot our date. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel's gaze softens. She looks at the box and back at Henry. Moving closer to him, she places a hand the box and raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">Promise it won't happen again?</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">Promise.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel smiles and leans in. They kiss and she takes the box.</p>
<p class="article-text">INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p class="article-text">The door opens and a LIGHT turns on.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry and Rachel walk inside, LAUGHING.</p>
<p class="article-text">They take off their coats and Henry hangs both on a chair in the kitchen. He puts a brown paper bag in the fridge. Rachel holds the box of chocolates.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">So it's decided.</p>
<p class="article-text">He walks into the living room and grabs the remote, turning on Netflix.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY(CONT'D)</p>
<p class="article-text">The Princess Bride. For the-</p>
<p class="article-text">(looks off in thought)</p>
<p class="article-text">third time.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry sits on the couch and Rachel tilts her head, raising her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">It's a classic.</p>
<p class="article-text">She waves the box.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL(CONT'D)</p>
<p class="article-text">Like chocolate.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry jumps from the couch and rushes to the kitchen. He takes the box from Rachel.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">I'm still pretty full. Why don't we save those for later?</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">I'm sure you have room for at least one.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel TUGS the box from Henry's grip. She gives him a look under furrowed brows and opens the box.</p>
<p class="article-text">It's EMPTY.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry GRIMACES and looks down. Rachel turns to him with wide eyes and an open mouth.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry holds up his hands.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">Okay, see-</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">What the hell is this?</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">To be fair, you said you were cutting back on sugar.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel SLAMS the box on the table.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">What?</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry runs his hand through his hair and shrugs.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">(muttering)</p>
<p class="article-text">I didn't have time to shop. I figured you wouldn't open it for a while.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel scoffs.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">You gave me your trash? And what was supposed to happen here, we could fight whenever I did open it?</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">You always complain about your roommate eating your food so I thought...</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel shoves him with both hands and grabs her coat from the chair.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">You are unbelievable.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry stands in front of her.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">So I'm not the best at gifts. Is that really the worst thing?</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel puts on her coat and pushes Henry aside.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">Not the best? You got me "diamond" earrings without the diamonds for Valentine's Day! They're just empty settings! Who the hell is that cheap?</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">Well... I stand by what I said! The diamond industry is corrupt. Those are a great statement piece.</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel squeezes her eyes shut and brings her hands to her temples.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">That's not what that means!</p>
<p class="article-text">Rachel marches to the door and turns back to Henry, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">RACHEL</p>
<p class="article-text">Your stupidity is just... inconceivable! Enjoy the rest of your date night without a date, okay?</p>
<p class="article-text">She opens the door and storms out, coat trailing behind her.</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry stands halfway to the door, mouth agape.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">Fine!</p>
<p class="article-text">He snatches the crumpled box from the table and charges to the door. He waves the box in front of him.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">(shouting)</p>
<p class="article-text">You know what? Maybe this box is a statement piece for how empty your heart is!</p>
<p class="article-text">Henry throws the box down the hall. His eyes well up and he sighs.</p>
<p class="article-text" id="dialogue-head">HENRY</p>
<p class="article-text">(shouting)</p>
<p class="article-text">Wait Rachel, I didn't mean it!</p>
<p class="article-text">He races down the hallway and disappears around the corner.</p>
<p class="article-text-last">FADE OUT.</p>
