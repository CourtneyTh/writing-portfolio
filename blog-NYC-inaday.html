<h2 class="article-title">NYC in a Day? Here's How We Did It</h2>
<p class="article-text-straight">If you only have one day to explore NYC, you’ll want to go there with a solid plan. Getting around the five boroughs requires more time and transit, so we opted to stick to Manhattan since it’s home to most of the iconic sites for tourists. We constructed a walking route totalling nearly 2 hours that allowed us to stop at a lot of the places we most wanted to visit. Planning all of this in advance saves time making decisions the day of your trip and lets you experience the city in the most stress-free way possible.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading">We started our NYC tour far downtown at the 9/11 Memorial. From there, we walked upward, stopping at Washington Square Park and then taking a short detour to browse the Three Lives and Company bookstore. One bookshop wasn’t enough for us, so we also stopped at the famous Strand Bookstore on our way through Union Square. We made our way up to Grand Central Terminal to marvel at the ornate astrological ceiling, and then made it to Rockefeller Center just in time for our admission to the Top of the Rock. My sister lives in Manhattan, so we met up for lunch after this and then debated on whether or not to stop at Times Square. We came to the consensus that Times Square is awful, but you have to see it when you visit NYC. So, we took a short walk over, craned our necks at all the massive bright advertisements, and then grabbed an Uber up to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. (We were pretty exhausted at this point!)</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">The Met was a nice change of pace from the business of Times Square. We had a leisurely walk, visiting the sculpture garden and period rooms wing. After spending over an hour at the Met (you could easily spend an entire day there) we ventured into Central Park and took a long stroll around. Our favourite part of the park was easily all the turtles we spotted in the pond. Someone happened to be feeding them so they kept poking their heads out of the water. We also spotted some giant fish in there with them!</p>
<p class="article-text-heading">Here's how we planned our trip:</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">Make a list of everything you might want to do</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">Your list will probably begin with some of the big attractions, like going up the Empire State Building and walking through Central Park. Go online (or ask some local New Yorkers if you happen to know any) to find some other things to add to your list. Don’t forget to look into places to eat too! If you happen to have more specific diets, this is an especially good idea, but it can also help you keep within your budget (if you wind up searching for a dinner spot near Central Park, you’ll have to shell out more than you may like!) Searching restaurants ahead of time can keep you from wasting time trying to find one on the day, and it can ensure that you’ll be eating somewhere that fits your diet and budget.</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">Also, think about some of the smaller things you might want to do. While there are a lot of great attractions to see in NYC, there are a lot of smaller gems that may be worth stopping at. We happen to be really into books, so we looked up some popular indie bookstores in NYC and added them to our list.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">Narrow down your list</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">Even if you’ve only done a bit of research, your list will probably have far more on it than you could ever fit into one day. This is the time to consider what you actually care about seeing and doing the most. For us, we decided that taking the ferry to the Statue of Liberty was far too time-consuming to be worth keeping on our list. We also crossed out items like the New York Catacombs and going up the One World Trade Center observatory.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">Map out your route</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">The best way to figure out how much you can actually schedule in a day is to create a route. We found using this feature on Google Maps to be extremely convenient, letting us add new stops along the way and save the route to follow later on the day of our trip. Manhattan is basically a long strip, so you’ll either want to start south and head north, or vice versa. We chose to start at the 9/11 memorial and travel upwards, ending our journey at Rockefeller Center.</p>
<p class="article-text-heading" id="article-text-heading">Be prepared to adjust your plan</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">On the actual day, you may not follow your plan exactly, but that’s okay. It can serve as a general guide, but making unexpected stops is all part of the fun when travelling. We actually found ourselves taking longer than expected to walk to Rockefeller Center, so another piece of advice is to not book in advance when possible. As we visited during the off-season for tourism, we waited to book tickets for the Top of the Rock Observation Deck at Rockefeller Center until the day of, which worked out well, because we got there an hour later than we planned. (If you’re wondering why we chose the Top of the Rock Observation Deck, check out our guide for the best way to view the NYC from above!)</p>
<p class="article-text-straight">In addition to this change, we also scrapped a few places from our list during the day. We initially planned to stop at two other bookstores - Gucci Wooster and Rizzoli - but decided that we had enough bookstores on our itinerary and would rather spend our time elsewhere. It also might be worth doing some more planning to avoid this (we didn’t realize that the Gucci Wooster Bookstore is actually part of a Gucci store…when we figured this out we weren’t very interested in visiting it). </p>
<p class="article-text-straight-last">Obviously there isn’t just one way to see New York City in a day - this is just how we did it. Take into account your own interests and priorities, use some of our planning methods, and come up with the perfect NYC in a day route for you! </p>
